#QUESTION AND ANSWER:
QUESTION: Why are exit and cd built-in command, as opposed to external executables (like ls or echo)?
ANSWER:
exit and cd are important to manage the shell function, where 'exit' is used for termination of shell and 'cd' is for chaning the directory. These being the fundamental functionalities, this should be ready to use and should not depend on any external executables. Hence, users can expect these commands to behvae consistently regardless of the specific shell environment they use.
